A multiplayer web server game - VCC GND
This is a multiplayer web server game based on the concepts of snakes and ladders, an ancient Indian board game. In the FIRA 2020 Social Distancing Competition, it will be used as a platform where participants can participate virtually.

FIRA 2020 Social Distancing Competition, Online Only Like most people, many FIRA participants have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are all sad that we cannot meet this year as was originally planned.

Instead of focusing on the negatives of the current pandemic, the FIRA HQ sees this current situation as an opportunity to grow. Therefore, FIRA will run online only competitions which are related to social distancing and isolation of the current as a new research challenge.

The task domains are based on the use of robotics technology in combating the current COVID-19 and future pandemics.

We will also hold several 1hr workshops where students can build and program a variety of robot systems from home.

All competitions and events of the FIRA 2020 Social Distancing event are open to FIRA Youth, FIRA Pro teams and various ragnes of age groups.
